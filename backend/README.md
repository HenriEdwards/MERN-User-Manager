## Backend

- Express, node based backend
- Uses MongoDB for main db, via Mongoose
- 'npm install' to install necessary depenecies
- 'npm run dev' to start development server

## Data & Connections

- Program retrieves the `MONGODB_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` and `PORT` variables from the .env file. Not included in the repo for security reasons.

  - Recommended to create your own `.env` file & `Users_DB` database.
  - Use the sample-data folder to create `credentials`, `divisions`, `ous` and `users` collections.
